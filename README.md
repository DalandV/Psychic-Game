# Psychic-Game

Welcome to The Psychic Game!

This is a fun little game built to practice my Javascript skills where you can try to guess what your computer is thinking. Just type in a letter and see if it's the letter your computer was thinking about. You get 9 tries after which you either guess the correct letter and win a round or you run out of guesses and you lose that round. 

Give it a try and have fun!
